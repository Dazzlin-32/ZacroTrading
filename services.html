                </h4>
                <p>
                    The legend of the origin of coffee dates back to ancient Ethiopia. It is said that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee when he noticed that his goats became unusually energetic after eating the berries from a certain tree. Curious about this, Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a newfound alertness and energy.
                 </p>
                <p>
                   Intrigued by the effects of these berries, Kaldi brought them to a local monastery, where the monks used them to make a drink. However, they found that the berries made them more awake during long hours of prayer, which they appreciated. The knowledge of these energizing berries soon spread, and the monks started cultivating and brewing coffee as a beverage to help them stay awake and alert during their nighttime devotions.
